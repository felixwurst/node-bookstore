# Node.js-Setup for a Bookstore

### Description:

For a front-end template, a corresponding back-end part is developed. It is an online bookshop where registered users can download or upload pdf-books. Unregistered users can only view the book details of the respective books, but can not download or upload books. The administrator can also add, edit and delete books.<br>
Various modules have been developed for storing the data in a database. So the data can now be stored using MongoDB, Mongoose or MySQL.
